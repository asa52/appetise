# Claude Rules for Appetise Project

## Project Overview
This is a recipe and inventory management application built with Python, using Pydantic for data validation and Pint for unit conversions.

## Code Style & Standards

### Python
- Use Python 3.14+ features where appropriate
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return types
- Prefer descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings to classes and public methods

### Pydantic Models
- Use Pydantic BaseModel for all data models
- Include Field descriptions for all model fields
- Keep models focused and single-purpose

### Unit Handling
- Always use Pint for unit conversions and comparisons
- Validate units using Pint's parse_expression
- Handle unit compatibility checks before conversions
- Provide clear error messages for invalid units

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Keep models in `model.py` unless they grow too large
- Separate concerns: data models, business logic, and I/O operations
- Use inheritance (like InventoryItem extending Ingredient) to follow DRY principles

### Error Handling
- Use descriptive error messages
- Handle unit conversion failures gracefully
- Validate inputs at model boundaries

### Documentation
- Include docstrings explaining the purpose of classes and methods
- Document complex logic, especially unit conversion logic
- Keep README.md updated with project changes

## Testing Considerations
- Write tests for unit conversions and compatibility checks
- Test edge cases for ingredient matching and quantity comparisons
- Ensure models validate correctly with various input types

## Dependencies
- Prefer using existing dependencies (pydantic, pint) rather than adding new ones
- Keep dependencies minimal and well-justified
- Use uv for dependency management (as indicated by uv.lock)

## General Guidelines
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Consider future extensibility
- Keep code readable and maintainable using SOLID principles
- Follow the existing code patterns and structure
